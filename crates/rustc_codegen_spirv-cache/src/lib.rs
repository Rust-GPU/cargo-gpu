//! Cacher of `rust-gpu` codegen for required toolchain.
//!
//! This library manages installations of `rustc_codegen_spirv`,
//! the codegen backend of rust-gpu to generate SPIR-V shader binaries.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! The codegen backend builds on internal, ever-changing interfaces of rustc,
//! which requires fixing a version of rust-gpu to a specific version of the rustc compiler.
//! Usually, this would require you to fix your entire project to that specific
//! toolchain, but this project loosens that requirement by managing installations
//! of `rustc_codegen_spirv` and their associated toolchains for you.
