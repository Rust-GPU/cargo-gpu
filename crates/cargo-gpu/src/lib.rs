//! Rust GPU shader crate builder.
//!
//! This program and library allows you to easily compile your rust-gpu shaders,
//! without requiring you to fix your entire project to a specific toolchain.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! This program primarily manages installations of `rustc_codegen_spirv`, the
//! codegen backend of rust-gpu to generate SPIR-V shader binaries. The codegen
//! backend builds on internal, ever-changing interfaces of rustc, which requires
//! fixing a version of rust-gpu to a specific version of the rustc compiler.
//! Usually, this would require you to fix your entire project to that specific
//! toolchain, but this project loosens that requirement by managing installations
//! of `rustc_codegen_spirv` and their associated toolchains for you.
//!
//! We continue to use rust-gpu's `spirv_builder` crate to pass the many additional
//! parameters required to configure rustc and our codegen backend, but provide you
//! with a toolchain agnostic version that you may use from stable rustc. And a
//! `cargo gpu` cmdline utility to simplify shader building even more.
//!
//! ## Where the binaries are
//!
//! We store our prebuild `rustc_spirv_builder` binaries in the default cache
//! directory of your OS:
//! * Windows: `C:/users/<user>/AppData/Local/rust-gpu`
//! * Mac: `~/Library/Caches/rust-gpu`
//! * Linux: `~/.cache/rust-gpu`
//!
//! ## How we build the backend
//!
//! * retrieve the version of rust-gpu you want to use based on the version of the
//!   `spirv-std` dependency in your shader crate.
//! * create a dummy project at `<cache_dir>/codegen/<version>/` that depends on
//!   `rustc_codegen_spirv`
//! * use `cargo metadata` to `cargo update` the dummy project, which downloads the
//!   `rustc_codegen_spirv` crate into cargo's cache, and retrieve the path to the
//!   download location.
//! * search for the required toolchain in `build.rs` of `rustc_codegen_spirv`
//! * build it with the required toolchain version
//! * copy out the binary and clean the target dir
//!
//! ## Building shader crates
//!
//! `cargo-gpu` takes a path to a shader crate to build, as well as a path to a directory
//! to put the compiled `spv` source files. It also takes a path to an output manifest
//! file where all shader entry points will be mapped to their `spv` source files. This
//! manifest file can be used by build scripts (`build.rs` files) to generate linkage or
//! conduct other post-processing, like converting the `spv` files into `wgsl` files,
//! for example.
